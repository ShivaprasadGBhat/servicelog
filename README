servicelog:

entries that are useful for performing system service operations, and for
providing a history of service operations that have been performed on the
system.

Note:
  - Package name may differ slightly between Linux distributors. Ex: RedHat and
    SLES ships development packages as "-devel" while Ubuntu ships it as "-dev"
    package. Please check your linux distribution package naming convention and
    make sure you have installed right packages.

Building:
---------
You can build on Power Linux system.

$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure [--prefix=/usr/]
$ make
$ make install

Building rpms:
--------------
To build a tarball to feed to rpmbuild, do

$ make dist-gzip

As an example, we use a command similar to the following:

$ rpmbuild -ba [--target=ppc/ppc64] <path-to-spec-file>

Hacking:
--------
All patches should be sent to the mailing list with linux-kernel style
'Signed-Off-By'. The following git commands are your friends:
- git commit -s
- git format-patch

You probably want to read the linux Documentation/SubmittingPatches as
much of it applies to libservicelog.

Submitting patch:
-----------------
We use same mailing list for all Power Linux VPD and diagnostics projects
(ppc64-diag, libvpd, lsvpd, [lib]servicelog). It is common convention to
prefix your subject line with project name. This lets maintainer and other
developers more easily identify patches from patches targeted to other
projects. For example,

  Subject: [servicelog PATCH 01/10] Summary phrase
